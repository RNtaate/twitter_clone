# Twitter Clone

## Project Description

This project involves building of a light weight version of Twitter following screen cast tutorials made by [Andy Leverenz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=5gUysPm64a4&feature=emb_logo)

The purpose of the project is to get familiar with authentication in ruby on rails and obtaining an experience with Devise in the process.

A user is able to sign-up and sign-in, create, edit, and delete their tweet, view tweets made by all users.  A user **can not** edit or delete a tweet created by another user.

The code to the above screen casts can be found on [github](https://github.com/justalever/twittter)
